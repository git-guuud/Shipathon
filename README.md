PDF-to-Word Converter and Translator: Intelligent Document Transformer
Problem Statement:
Create an AI-powered tool that converts PDFs (text or image-based) from any language into Word documents in English. The tool should ensure accurate translation, preserve formatting, and include a basic evaluation system to assess quality.
Methodology:
  Text Extraction: Use the Gemini API to extract text from image-based PDFs via OCR.
  Language Detection and Translation: Identify the source language using a detection tool and translate the text into English using an LLM-based translation API.
  Formatting Recreation: Use libraries like Python-docx to recreate the original structure (headings, tables, paragraphs) in the Word document.
  Evaluation System: Implement basic checks for translation accuracy and formatting fidelity. Allow users to view evaluation scores and refine outputs if necessary.
Optional Advancements:
  Add support for complex layouts (e.g., multi-column PDFs).
  Introduce feedback loops to improve translation quality.
  Customize evaluation metrics for specific document types.
